    <h1>on plunges</h1>

    <blockquote>
        If you repeated today, over and over, where would you be in 10 years?

    <br/>

    <p>
        Life has no signposts.<br/>
        There's nobody to tell you to speed up or slow down.<br/>
        There's nothing preventing you from smelling roses or falling in brambles.<br/>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I think we feel lost because there's no absolute destination.<br/>
        Most people agree that maximizing the happiness of yourself and others is a decent way to live. But even this is a tricky endeavor - exercising and eating ice cream make me happy in very different ways!
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Lately, instead of maximizing happiness, I've been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwG_qR6XmDQ">minimizing regret</a>.<br/>
        Which will haunt me more: spending my evenings with friends, or spending my evenings with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends">Friends</a>?
    </p>
    
    <p>
        They say that hindsight is 20/20. 
        Regret-minimization asks you to anticipate what your life's rear-view mirror will look like down the road.<br/>
        It encourages you to look past your immediate desires - to act in your best long-term interest.
    </p>

    <p>
        Most regrets aren't things that we did. They're things that we <em>didn't</em> do.<br/>
        Our greatest ghosts are unspoken words, wasted time, missed opportunities. These are the scariest spectres that dance in our dreams.<br/>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        So what if you had actually taken the time to travel? 
        If you had actually pursued your tap-dancing career?<br/>
        Well, it probably would've failed.
    </p> 

    <p>
        There's a reason most people aren't following their dreams.<br/>
        It's because lofty goals demand <em>a lot</em> of risk and <em>a lot</em> of work.
    </p> 

    <p>
        So what does regret minimization look like then?<br/>
        Sometimes it means exercising, eating well, and saving money.<br/>
        It also means clearing your schedule to tap-dance, or whatever your plunge is.
    </p>

        I recently realized that I would regret spending my 20s in an office. I was doing things I didn't care about to live in a place I didn't have the time or money to experience!<br/>
        I want to spend as much of my time making things as possible - it's what I love to do!<br/>
        Fortunately, I've been spending the past few years honing skills that allow me to work more flexibly. So my next plunge is applying to <a href="https://www.toptal.com/web">Toptal</a>, where I'll be able to work flexible hours on interesting projects. Sites like <a href="https://www.upwork.com/">Upwork</a> and <a href="https://www.craigslist.org/about/sites">Craigslist</a> seem a bit overcrowded, with too much risk of landing bad clients. Toptal has a very selective screening process, which will be great if I get accepted! It'll mean better-pay and higher-quality clients, which ultimately means more time to write essays, bake bread, build robots, make music, and play with lasers.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        What I'm trying to say is that successful plunges don't look like plunges at all.<br/>
        Change your plunge from cliff-diving into community-pool-low-board. Because you'll probably fail a few times, and unsuccessful cliff-dives don't afford you another chance.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Minimize regret and mitigate risk.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        In other words, successful plunges require you to remove dirty obstacles coming down the pipe.
    </p>

        <!-- i recently realized that i would regret monotony -->
        <!-- but i had to hedge my bets -->
        <!-- luckily, there are services like toptal, which allow me more flexibility -->
    </p>
    
    <!-- taking plunges is all about removing obstacles. i guess you could say it's a lot like plunging -->
